# Notes about template / layout

Get the template here:
https://github.com/BlackrockDigital/startbootstrap-sb-admin-2

Take the style file: css/sb-admin-2.css
and the js file: js/sb-admin-2.js
and copy them in app/assets/stylesheets/ and app/assets/javascripts/ directories.

In the latter comment cut the 'Toggle the side navigation' (at)
and paste it in app/assets/javascripts/application.js



## Using datatables library



in 'jquery.dataTables.css'
replace every occurence of   url("/assets/sort_
with   url("/assets/sort_
-- no, more i commented these
